## Firebase usage

Firebase, as a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS), is used for real-time database management. It stores target locations in Firestore, and target icons in storage enables storage management. Whenever a user selects a particular character on the application, a real-time check is carried out on the backend to validate whether the selected location is accurate or not.
